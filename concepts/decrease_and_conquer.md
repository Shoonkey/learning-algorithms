# Decrease and Conquer algorithms

*Decrease and conquer* algorithms decreases the size of the main problem on every iteration until the problem is solved.

## Example

[Binary search](/algorithms/binary_search.md) is an example. Every time it solves a single smaller subproblem as it searches for the element in the array.
